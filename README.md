## Dependencies

- from PHP: No dependencies . Only Laravel already in features. 
- from OS PHP: Docker and Docker compose
- Developed using Windows 10 with WSL2 which Ubuntu OS based.

## How to run

1. Checkout the project from git: `git clone https://github.com/getJv/qanda.git`
2. Go into project folder. `aka.: qanda`
3. execute one of the following action: 
   * `sh qanda-bigbang.sh` - to execute all steps in once
   *  To execute directly on you favorite terminal:
   ```
     docker-compose up -d && docker exec --user 1000 backend composer install && docker exec -it backend php artisan qanda:interactive  
   ```
4. Enjoy!

### Useful commands:
* `docker exec -it backend bash` To go into the container
* Once inside you can run:
   * `php artisan test --filter=QandaTest` to check the tests
   * `php artisan qanda:interactive` to execute the app in a clean window
   * `php artisan qanda:interactive --sequential` to execute in a verbose mode. 


### Important notes
 
* If something goes wrong, you can open the file `qanda-bigbang.sh` and execute each command one-by-one. Sometimes the OS play with us... :(
* I'm using my own php docker image... sometimes you can get some xdebug messages at console... please ignore them.
* The .env file was commit for time-saver purposes. (Don't do that in home people :D )
* If thing going awful, please free feel to call/text me.
